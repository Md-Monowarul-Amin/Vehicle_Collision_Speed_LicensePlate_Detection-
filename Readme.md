# Vehicle Collision Detection, Speed Tracking, and License Plate Recognition

This project utilizes **YOLO v11** and **OpenCV** in Python to detect vehicle collisions, track their speed, and recognize license plates from video footage. The system enables real-time monitoring and analysis of traffic activities, making it useful for accident prevention, law enforcement, and traffic management.

## üöÄ Features
- **Vehicle Detection**: Identifies vehicles on roads in real-time.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects potential vehicle collisions based on movement patterns. Surrounds the cars in potential risk by RED bounding boxex if two cars are very close to each other.

- **Speed Tracking**: Estimates vehicle speed from video frames. Used **PerspectiveTransform** from **OpenCV** to detect displacement of objects on birds eye view.

- **License Plate Recognition**: Detects and reads license plates using a trained YOLO v11 model.
